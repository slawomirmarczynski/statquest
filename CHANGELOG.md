# Changelog

## 0.4.0.0

### Changes

- frequency tables etc. moved from statquest_statistics
- statquest_statistic should now contain only statistical tests

### Restart

- A big restart of the project as a direct continuation (branch/fork) of *ProQuest*.
- Numbering will be continued, thus 0.4.0.0 instead 0.1.0.0.
- Project name has been renamed from *ProQuest* to *StatQuest*.
  The name reflects the change of the domain. *ProQuest* was
  dedicated to a very specific domain. *StatQuest* is planned
  to be usable more widely as a general tool.
- Files has been renamed.

## 0.3.2.2

- The last (and succesful) version of *ProQuest* 
  written by Sławomir Marczyński.
