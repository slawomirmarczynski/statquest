    Pearson's Chi-Square Test of Independence.

    We have got cases that are described using two categorical variables
    using appropriate nominal scales. We want to find out if these
    variables are independent, i.e. whether the features described by
    the scales are significantly different.

    We formulate the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis:

        H0: There is no relationship between the categorical variables.
        H1: Categorical variables are not independent.

    We calculate the chi-square statistic for the corresponding crosstab,
    then we compare the p-value with the alpha significance level.
    Customary the alpha significance level is assumed to be 0.05
    (i.e. 5%), specifying it as "significant". A significance level of
    0.001 is sometimes referred to as "highly significant".

    If p-value is too small, the test reject the null hypothesis.

    If p-value is  big - "we have no grounds to reject the null
    hypothesis" - de facto we just take the null hypothesis.

    In the table form it looks like this:

                                  H0    H1
                -----------------------------------------------
                p_value < alpha:  no    yes   are dependent
                p_value > alpha:  yes   no    are NOT dependent
